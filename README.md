# Welcome to the Sacral Slide Factory

This project is about developing an app for creating song lists and lyrics slides for the holy mass.
On the main page you can choose songs for specific places of the list and you can download their slides az zipped pngs.

## How this project came to be

I'm member of a Christian community in Budapest, Hungary and I regularly take part in the musical service, playing the guitar and the flute. Beyond practicing and playing music during the church service, the musicians also need to bring the lyrics of their chosen songs so that everybody can sing along and the holy mass is really an event for the whole community.
For this task we currently use an Excel file with some macros. It comes with ca. 470 jpg files (the slides with lyrics on them) and altogether it makes up a 70MB zip file, which is distributed through email.
Although this is a very lightweight and simple solution, I feel the need for improvement. This is why I came up with the idea of this web app, which is platform independent by definition, accessible for anyone who has an internet connection, and always up to date. And on top of that, it would have a nice UI and offer some help choosing songs for a Sunday. Oh and most importantly, it would be available for people in any Hungarian Christian community.

## Lyrics

Lyrics are the key for this project. Fortunately I have sources to work with so I don't have to type hundreds and hundreds of pages of lyrics. However, my sources need cleaning and I assigned a [separate repository](https://github.com/zslim/song-slides-data-sources "Lyrics cleaning repo") for that.

## Contributors welcome

As of March 2019, I'm mostly working in the lyrics repo when I work on this project. I gained a lot of programming experience since I started this so the app desperately needs a new UI and the back end needs at least to be refactored but rather to be written againg from scratch. I'm planning on involving a team into the development. If you're interested, contact me. :)
