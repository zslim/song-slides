# Welcome to the Sacral Slide Factory

This project is about developing an app for creating song lists and lyrics slides for the holy mass.
On the main page you can choose songs for specific places of the list and you can download their slides az zipped pngs.

## How this project came to be

I'm member of a Christian community and I regularly take part in the musical service, playing the guitar and the flute. Beyond practicing and playing music during the church service, the musicians also need to bring the lyrics of their chosen songs so that everybody can sing along and the holy mass is really an event for the whole community.
For this task we currently use an Excel file with some macros. It comes with ca. 470 jpg files (the slides with lyrics on them) and altogether it makes up a 70MB zip file, which is distributed through email.
Although this is a very lightweight and simple solution, I feel the need for improvement. This is why I came up with the idea of this web app, which is platform independent by definition, accessible for anyone who has an internet connection, and always up to date. And on top of that, it would have a nice UI and offer some help choosing songs for a Sunday. Oh and most importantly, it would be available for people in any Christian community.

## Contributors welcome

As of March 2019, this project is on the level of a pet project and I don't spend time with it very often. However, I'd like to take it further and for that I need a team. If you're interested, contact me. :)
