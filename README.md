# Welcome to the Sacral Slide Factory

This project is about developing an app for creating song lists and lyrics slides for the holy mass.
On the main page you can choose songs for specific places of the list and you can download their slides az zipped pngs.

## Some long term tasks

* Aria attributes
* Refactoring (with help if necessary)

## Things to think about

* Deployment: what state is acceptable for deployment?
* Output format: what options should be offered?
* Song upload: what requirements should be posed?
* Tagging system: like at all
* Logging song popularity?
* How-to section
* Do I need algorithmic line length handling in the parsing section?
